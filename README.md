My talk on GAMs given at IPA-IAL 2018, June 19th: *Estimating rates and magnitudes of temporal change: using generalized additive models with stratigraphic records*

The slide deck was prepared using RMarkdown and the Xaringan package, and the `simpson-talk.html` file needs to be opened in a web browser. The PDF version may be easier to use quickly, and is available [here](https://github.com/gavinsimpson/ipa-ial-2018-talk/raw/master/simpson-talk.pdf).
